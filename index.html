      <h2>Publishing Bots in Action</h2>
      <div class="section-subtitle">Publishing bots made by SixJupiter are already helping brands and publishers provide their audience with reliable information to keep them coming back. See an example from our <strong>Daily Bitcoin Bot</strong>, which summarizes Bitcoin&#x27;s price and blockchain activity from the previous day.</div>
      <div class="text-block"><span class="text-span">August 28, 2019: Bitcoin Drops 0.46%, Falling for the Second Day in a Row<br><br>Bitcoin: What’s the Latest Regarding its Price?</span><br><br>Bitcoin’s price at the moment is clocking in at $10,178.73, which means that since yesterday, it is down about 1.86%. The past 24 hours mark a reversal in price from the day prior. It should be noted, though, that price is still in an unclear trend, and is currently 4.43% below its 20 day moving average; staying above this level may be critical to sustain short-term momentum. Given that its distance from its 20 day moving average of $10,651.07 is close, it may mean that climbing above the 20 day moving average may help foster bullish momentum. On the flip side, for those who prefer a rangebound view when trading, Bitcoin’s trading range — based on its momentum and volatility over the past two weeks — is between $10,124.77 and $11,177.37 (in US dollars). In terms of its overall importance in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin’s current market capitalization is $182.54 billion US dollars, which is about 68.39% of the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s dominance level has been without a clear trend over the past two weeks, fluctuating between 67.16% and 68.64%. As its dominance level doesn’t have a clear direction at the moment, one could argue it isn’t clear yet whether altcoins will survive — or if Bitcoin will capture the entire market and the vast majority of use cases for cryptocurrencies.<br>‍</div><img src="images/BTC-2019-08-27.png" srcset="images/BTC-2019-08-27-p-500.png 500w, images/BTC-2019-08-27-p-800.png 800w, images/BTC-2019-08-27.png 880w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 880px" alt="" class="image-5">
      <div class="text-block-2"><span class="text-span-2">Daily Engagement and Hash Rate Metrics Update</span><br><br>Yesterday, the Bitcoin blockchain saw 318,219 transactions recorded on it. The trend in daily transactions is not clear, though it should be noted that transactions have dropped by about 3.85% over the past week. If Bitcoin does not grow transactions, it may need to derive its value as a money to protect against political turmoil. In terms of transaction fees, the average cost for sending Bitcoin yesterday ended up being approximately $1.08 US dollars. The average transaction fee has been declining at a rate of about 16.61% per week, but the average amount of money sent in transactions, in US dollars, is down 15.12% week over week. Bitcoin’s transaction fee and average transaction value are both declining, though that is likely to change if Bitcoin’s price sustains a stronger rally going forward. Regarding Bitcoin’s hash rate, which serves as a measure of the network’s computational power, it has managed to bounce around over the past 30 days. It has been gaining daily by a rate of approximately 0.06%. Given the unclear trend in bitcoin mining, it may be that hash rate is getting harder to interpret; this could result in the chain’s security being something to keep an eye on. As such, this might not enable Bitcoin to attract more high value transactions.<br><br><span class="text-span-3">What are the Richest Hodlers Doing?</span><br><br>There are 560.84 million Bitcoin wallets with at least some positive amount of Bitcoin, but only 2.52% of those wallets have received or sent Bitcoin in the past 30 days. The number of monthly active users is in an unclear trend, moving about 5,391.254 per day over the past two weeks. Over 90.56% of the outstanding Bitcoin is held by the top 1% of Bitcoin wallets.</div>

      <h2 class="heading-5">Understanding the Response</h2>
      <div class="text-block-4">After you make the API call, here&#x27;s the response you can expect:<br>‍</div>
      <blockquote class="block-quote"><br>    &quot;title&quot;: [&quot;August 29, 2019: Bitcoin Down 6.97%; 3rd Straight Down Day&quot; ],<br>    &quot;text&quot;: [ &quot;&lt;h2&gt;Bitcoin Price Update&lt;/h2&gt; Bitcoin is down about 6.97% from the previous day, putting its price at $9,423.21 US dollars at the time of this writing. This marks the 3rd day in a row that Bitcoin has been down, but the coin is trending unclear. It is currently 9.78% below its 20 day moving average of $10,445.03, which is somewhat close; a climb up to the 20 day moving average may be needed before momentum buyers come in. Alternatively, for those interested in trading ranges that Bitcoin bounces between, its current two week trading range in US dollars is between $9,825.11 and $11,064.96. In terms of its overall importance in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin&#x27;s current market capitalization is $169.45 billion US dollars, which is about 68.79% of the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin&#x27;s dominance level has been without a clear trend over the past two weeks, fluctuating between 67.82% and 68.79%. Without a clear trend in dominance, the jury is still up for grabs as to whether or not Bitcoin will be the only cryptocurrency that succeeds. &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to trade Bitcoin? Consider the following brokers:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=https://httpslink.com/m63a target=blank&gt;Binance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=https://httpslink.com/imrm target=blank&gt;CoinDirect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=https://httpslink.com/2ffc target=blank&gt;WCX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src =https://storage.googleapis.com/sjn-charts/btc-charts/BTC-2019-08-29.png&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Update on Transactions and Hash Rate&lt;/h2&gt; 341,200 transactions were recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain yesterday. The trend in daily transactions is not clear, though it should be noted that transactions have risen by about 1.13% over the past week. Ultimately, if the currency does regularly succeed in growing transactions on its chain, its primary utility may be as a way to acquire goods or services. Yesterday, Bitcoin&#x27;s average fee per transaction came in at $1. Transaction fees have been declining by approximately 22.12% per week, while the average transaction size is down 11.22% in US dollars.  Regarding Bitcoin&#x27;s hash rate, which serves as a measure of the network&#x27;s computational power, it has managed to bounce around  over the past 30 days. It has been rising daily by rate of approximately 0.09%. A trend in hash rate that is unclear suggests that mining is becoming harder to understand, and that the chain is thus being something to keep an eye on. This may not help Bitcoin attract more high value transactions. &lt;h2&gt;How Active are Bitcoin&#x27;s Richest Wallets?&lt;/h2&gt; There are 561.99 million Bitcoin wallets with at least some positive amount of Bitcoin, but only 2.53% of those wallets have received or sent Bitcoin in the past 30 days. In terms of engagement, note that the number of monthly active users in Bitcoin has been rising by about 12,660.87 per day. The top 1% of Bitcoin wallets hold over 90.45% of the outstanding Bitcoin. &lt;img height=0 width=0 src=https://pixel.watch/el12&gt;&lt;p style=text-align:center&gt;Article by &lt;a href=https://sixjupiter.com target=_blank&gt;SixJupiter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],<br>    &quot;publication_time&quot;: [  &quot;2019-08-29 14:52:53&quot;],<br>    &quot;word_count&quot;: [447],<br>    &quot;price_per_word&quot;: [0],<br>    &quot;total_price&quot;: [ 0<br>}</blockquote>
      <div>Let&#x27;s break it down step-by-step:<br>‍</div>
      <ul>
        <li>The API response will contain <strong>six keys</strong>: title, text, publication time, word count, price per word, and total price. </li>
        <li><strong>Title:</strong> This is the title of the article that has been generated.</li>
        <li><strong>Text:</strong> This is the article itself. You&#x27;ll notice it is HTML formatted, with section headings wrapped in &lt;h2&gt; tags, images included with absolute paths you are welcome to continue using, and &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; tags for listed points. Just plug and play as needed!</li>
        <li><strong>Publication time:</strong> This refers to the time, in UTC, the content object was published. This is useful for understanding how fresh the content is. </li>
        <li><strong>Word count, price per word, and total price:</strong> The last three fields are used to ensure pricing is transparent. Simply multiply the word count by the price per word to understand the total price. Remember that you are only billed for an API call that returns unique content. For instance, if you have a content ID like that gets a new article each day (like the Daily Bitcoin article), you are only charged for the first call made on a given day. If you make a subsequent call to request the same content again later that day, you will not be charged for it. </li>
