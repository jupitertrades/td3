			<td>First, the amount of currency held by the top 1,000 holders that (1) have NOT been identified, (2) are not used to burn currency,
and after these removals have occurred, (3) are not the wallet with the most units of currency is calculated. This amount is then    
divided by the available supply of currency. This metric is very similar to the *anon_* metrics, except the wealthiest wallet has been removed.
This is because the wealthiest wallet is often the default wallet that holds created but unissued currency. </td>
		</tr>

<tr>
			<td>minus_topnbni_pct_total</td>
			<td>The same as minus_topnbni_pct_available, except the denominator is now the total supply of currency issued. </td>
		</tr>


<tr>

			<td>tags</td>
			<td>Natural language processing, using SixJupiter's artificial intelligence, of the description of the currency to assign it to one or multiple sectors. This feature is experimental; 
some values may not be useful, and the majority of currencies will not have a tag. </td>
