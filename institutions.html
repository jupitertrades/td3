<h2>Culture/Employee Reviews Data</h2>

Data regarding employee satisfaction and culture has been linked to <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/company-culture-pay/">outperformance in share price</a>.
With this in mind, SixJupiter has worked to create a data set that tracks employee satisfaction and culture, based on
data available on review sites like <a href="https://glassdoor.com">Glassdoor</a> and other properties, to provide
investors with a picture of how a company's internal culture and employee satisfaction are changing over time.
