            <h2>Terms of Service for Data Products</h2>
            
All data purchases made through SixJupiter are governed by the following terms:

<h3>Restrictions on Redistribution</h3>

<p>Clients of SixJupiter's data service may not redistribute data products. Your use of SixJupiter data is exclusively for 
personal or professional research purposes and may not be utilized to build an application intended for use by end users 
other than for you or the entity on behalf of which you entered into these Terms. You must disclose in any printed or 
shared document containing SixJupiter data either the SixJupiter logo or reference that the data is from SixJupiter. 
For example, you may use the data to create reports (e.g. analyst reports), provided that the data is presented in a 
static manner and repackaged in a form that adds additional information or analysis of the data beyond basic sharing 
of the data itself in isolation. You may not, however, include SixJupiter data identified as being provided with no 
redistribution rights in any application or otherwise provide or display the data to a third-party in a dynamic manner 
(i.e. frequently updating the data being displayed (through technological means relating to an API call or otherwise) 
as opposed to presenting the data within a certain set once as it exists at a specific moment in time). In the event 
the Product Terms include additional or conflicting terms with respect to the non-redistribution use parameters, such 
Product Terms shall apply and supersede these Terms where they conflict.

</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>To be eligible to use the Services, you represent and warrant that you: (i) are at least 18 years of age, or 
otherwise over the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside; (ii) are not currently restricted from 
the Services and are not otherwise prohibited from having an account related thereto; (iii) will only provide accurate 
information to SixJupiter; (iv) have full power and authority to enter into these Terms and doing so will not violate 
any other agreement to which you are a party; and (v) will not violate any rights of SixJupiter or a third party.

You assume all responsibility for your use of, and access to, the Services. Accounts are for a single user, company or 
other legal entity, as applicable. Any multiple-party use, other than individual use on behalf of a company or other 
legal entity, is prohibited. For example, sharing a login between non-entity individual users is prohibited.</p>

<h3>Right to Restrict or Terminate Access</h3>

<p>SixJupiter may deny or restrict your access to all or part of the Services without notice in its reasonable discretion 
if it deems that you have engaged in any conduct or activities that SixJupiter in its reasonable discretion believes 
violates the letter or spirit of any of these Terms. If SixJupiter denies or restricts your access to the Services 
because of such a violation, you shall have no right to obtain any refund or credit for the subscriptions fees you have 
paid.</p>

<p>You may terminate these Terms by terminating your use of the Services and any related account. SixJupiter may terminate 
these Terms for any reason or no reason at any time. In the event that these Terms or the Services are terminated, you 
acknowledge and agree that you will continue to be bound by these Terms. Following termination, you shall immediately 
cease use of the Services and any license granted to you under any agreement related to your use of the Services shall 
immediately terminate. Upon termination, SixJupiter reserves the right to delete all of your Content, data, and other 
information stored on SixJupiter's servers. SixJupiter will not be liable to you or any third party as a result of the 
termination of these Terms or the Services or for any actions taken by SixJupiter pursuant to these Terms as a result 
of such termination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, SixJupiter will not be liable to you or any third 
party for damages, compensation, or reimbursement relating to your use of the Services, or the termination thereof.</p>

<p>Any sections or terms which by their nature should survive or are otherwise necessary to enforce the purpose of these 
Terms, will survive the termination of these Terms and termination of the Services. Termination of these Terms or the 
Services does not relieve you from your obligation to pay SixJupiter any amounts owed to SixJupiter.</p>

<h3>Disclaimers</h3>

<p>Actual service coverage, speeds, locations and quality may vary. SixJupiter will attempt to provide the Services at all 
times, except for limited periods for maintenance and repair. However, the Services may be subject to unavailability
 for a variety of factors beyond our control including emergencies, third-party service failures, transmission, equipment
 or network problems or limitations, interference, signal strength, and may be interrupted, limited or curtailed. 
Delays or omissions may occur. We are not responsible for data, messages or pages lost, not delivered, delayed or 
misdirected because of interruptions or performance issues with the Services or communications services or networks. 
We may impose usage or Services limits, suspend the Services, or block certain kinds of usage in our sole discretion 
to protect users or the Services. The accuracy and timeliness of data received is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>SixJupiter is not a registered investment advisor or broker/dealer. You are advised that the material contained herein 
should be used solely for informational purposes. You should always conduct your own research and due diligence 
and obtain professional advice before making any investment decision. Neither SixJupiter nor its other users will be 
liable for any loss or damage caused by a reliance on information obtained in any Services Content or User Content.</p>

<p>YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. ALL SITE CONTENT AND THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND 
“AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, CUSTOM, TRADE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, 
NONINFRINGEMENT, AVAILABILITY OR ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. SIXJUPITER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE 
AVAILABLE, WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR WILL OPERATE IN AN UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE OR COMPLETELY SECURE MANNER 
OR THAT ERRORS OR DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. SIXJUPITER DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR CONDITIONS 
REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SERVICES, IN TERMS OF THEIR ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, 
COMPLETENESS, OR OTHERWISE.</p>

<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, OR ALLOW 
LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
IN SUCH EVENT, SIXJUPITER’S WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST 
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN SUCH JURISDICTION.</p>

<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>

<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL SIXJUPITER, ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, LICENSORS OR OTHER THIRD 
PARTY PARTNERS (“SIXJUPITER PARTIES”) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, 
EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR THE RESULTS OF USE OF OUR SERVICES, 
WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY; INCLUDING WITHOUT 
LIMITATION DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, WHETHER DIRECT OR 
INDIRECT, ARISING OUT OF THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR THE RESULTS OF USE OF OUR SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, 
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY. YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT 
SHALL BE FOR YOU TO DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>

<p>A SIXJUPITER PARTY’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID 
SIXJUPITER FOR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IN THE PRIOR THREE (3) MONTHS; AND (B) THE SUM OF ONE HUNDRED (100) 
US DOLLARS.</p>

<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL SIXJUPITER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INVESTMENT GAIN/LOSS YOU INCUR DURING YOUR INVESTMENT IN ANY SPECULATIVE
MARKET. FINANCIAL SPECULATION IS RISKY. THE PAST PERFORMANCES OF ANY PERSON(S) DO NOT GUARANTEE THEIR FUTURE 
PERFORMANCES.</p>

<p>SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN SUCH STATES OR 
JURISDICTIONS, THE SIXJUPITER PARTIES’ LIABILITY TO YOU SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

<p>EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR 
EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN 
THE PRICING OFFERED BY SIXJUPITER TO YOU AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. 
EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. 
</p>

<h3>Changes to Terms</h3>

<p>We may add to, change or remove any part of these Terms, at any time without prior notice to you other than listing 
of a later effective date than the one set forth at the top of these Terms. Such modification shall be effective 
immediately upon posting at the Site. As your next visit to the Site or use of the Services may be governed by 
different Terms, we encourage you to look for a new effective date on these Terms when you visit the Site or use the 
Services. It is your responsibility to check these Terms periodically for changes. If we make any material changes to 
these Terms, we will endeavor to provide registered users with additional notice of any changes, such as at your e-mail 
address of record or when you log-in to your account.</p>

<p>Your use or continued use of the Services following the posting or notice of any changes to these Terms or any other 
posted policies shall constitute your acceptance of the changed Terms or policies.</p>
